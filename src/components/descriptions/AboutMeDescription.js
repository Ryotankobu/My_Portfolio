        Hi, I'm a third-year Bachelor of Information Technology student at
        Griffith University, graduating in October 2025 with a GPA of 6.2. I
        bring diverse professional experience, having worked as a client
        representative at a Japanese trading company and as a marketing manager
        at an international school in Australia. These roles taught me how to
        communicate effectively, manage projects, and adapt quicklyâ€”skills I now
        bring into the tech space. I'm currently seeking an IT internship to
        further develop my coding skills and gain industry experience. My focus
        is on front-end development, and I've completed several projects using
        JavaScript and React, where I enjoyed transforming ideas into
        responsive, user-friendly web applications.
